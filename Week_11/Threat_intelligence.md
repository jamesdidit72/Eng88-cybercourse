# Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)
#### Definition:
It is information an organization uses to understand the threats that have, will, or are currently targeting the organization.
## MITRE ATT&CK
- Adversarial Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge (ATT&CK)
- A knowledge base of adversary behaviour
- Free, open and globally accessible
- Based on real world observation
- Focus on: Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
- Use knowledge of adversary to help defenders
- Shift from indicators to behaviours
- using common knowledge

### Pyramid of Pain
- Hash values = Easy
- IP addresses = Easy
-   
- networking
-
- tools
- TTPs

## Mapping ATT&CK to CTI
- 1. understand
- 2. map data
- 3. Store and analyse
- 4. Defence Recommendation    

## Mapping to an ATT&CK
- 1. Find Behaviour
    - check what adversary/ software does
    - Analyse initial compromise and post-compromise
    - Such as:
        - Running a command
        - creating a foothold/ task
        - establishing a connection
        - sending data
- 2. Research Behaviour
    - consult other teams (red, blue team etc)
    - search on the internet
    - search academic and security-focus journal and reports
    - time-consuming, but builds knowledge
    - example:
        - protocol
        - port
        - command
- 3. Behaviour -> tactics
    - what are they trying to accomplish?
    - 12 tactics (check word doc)
- 4. Find technique
    - technique is a special behaviour to achieve a goal and is often a single step
    - toughest part
    - a behaviour might not be a technique
    - search MITRE ATT&CK (key words, commands etc)
- 5. Compare Results    
    - different interpretation from analysing the same situation/ case
    - analysts have bias
    - this is normal
    - ensure to discuss the results
    
### Mapping to ATT&CK from raw data
- more data available at procedure level
- working on the case from scratch (without someones bias)
- need great technical knowledge
- 

- find behaviour
