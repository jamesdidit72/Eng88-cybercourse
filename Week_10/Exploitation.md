# Exploitation
Two categories of computer exploits
- Known Exploits: They are known to the system or software developers
- Unknown Exploits: suggest that there is no documentation of this or any current solution
## exploit types
### exploit naming
- the type vulnerability they exploit (such as BOF or Dangling Pointer)
- whether they are local or remote exploits:
    - local are vulnerabilities that need to be performed on the same machine
    - remote are vulnerabilities exploited from a network at a distance
- it can be the result of running the exploit (DoS, spoofing etc)    

- commonly associated with networking hardware
- common in many legacy operating systems
- administrators sometimes create privileged user accounts in a rush and leave the password null/empty
- most common in wireless access points and preconfigured secure server appliances
### network exploits
- IP Spoofing
- Man in the Middle 
- Firewall Traversal
- ARP poisoning
- WLAN
### Eavesdropping
- works mostly with plaintext transmission protocols
- remote attackers must have access to a compromised system
- preventive measures includes services with cryptography
### service vulnerabilities
- http based services are vulnerable to remote commands
- services that have vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows
- admins should make sure that services do not run as the root user
- some exploits used against web-servers:
    - session hijacking
    - SQL injection
    - Directory Traversal
    - Code Injection
    - Cross-site Scripting
- URL manipulation through HTTP GET Methods
- Password Cracking  
- some techniques used to attack services: bufferflow, format string, DoS, Covert Channels, Authentication Bypass




### Host based Vulnerability
- workstations and desktops are more prone to exploitation
- Safeguards can be implemented such that email client software

### DoS attack
- ping flood attack: the most reported DoS case in the US occurred in 2000
- source packets are usually forged (sent from a machine that randomises the ip in each packet)
- IDS/IPS/IDP: advances in ingress filtering (IETF rfc2267)

## Exploit kits
- exploit kits are tools embedded in compromised web pages
- they automatically scan a visitors machine for vulnerabilities and attempt to exploit them
- if the exploit succeeds the kit injects malware to users system
- they are easy of use and they have friendly interface that allows non-expert users to deploy them as well
- because exploit kits work in the background, it can be difficult to know when youre under attack
- There are measures that can help you protect against these attacks, such as avoiding unknown links and keeping software up to date
