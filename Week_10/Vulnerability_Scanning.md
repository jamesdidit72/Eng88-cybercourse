# Vulnerability Scanning
## Introduction
- Vulnerability scanning is the act of identifying potential vulnerabilities in the network devices 
  - such as: 
    - firewalls
    - routers
    - switches
    - servers
    - applications
    
A vulnerability scanner:
- scans specified set of ports on a remote host
- tires to test the service offered at each port for its known vulnerabilities
- it is automated
- does not exploit the vulnerabilities
- its scope is business-wide
- requires automated tools to manage a high number of assets
## Vulnerability Data-Source
CVE (common vulnerabilities and exposures)

## Vulnerability Categories
- outdated software (firmware)
- mis-configured software
- poorly developed applications
    - website attacks
    - mobile application attacks
- cloud applications
- data breaches (data leaked to the public)
- vulnerabilities in shares of the form `\\server\share over the SMB protocol` (sharing a folder)

## Vulnerability Scanner 
### Types
- The main different types of vulnerability scanners you'll see will be:
  - network vulnerability scanner (check and probe each service for information, does what nmap does, but across a network)
  - wireless scanners (scans wireless access points for vulnerabilities)
  - agent-based scanners (scans your local system then sends the results to the main scanner)
  - web application scanners (specialised for web apps, crawl the links, then check them against the vulnerabilities)
  - Database scanners (identifies weakness in the db)
  
### vulnerability scanning scheduling strategy (depends on the users needs)
- change based (dependant of what the user is doing (new software, new vulnerability, etc))
-  hygiene based (when you suspect that you network is vulnerable)
- compliance based (keeping up with GPDR etc, compliant with a certain standards)
### running the scans
- what you need to ask before runnng the scan:
  - Are your systems accessible to the scanner? (security system may block the scan)
  - are any of your systems protected by an IPS?IDS or WAF? ()
  - Do you need authentication
### Nessus
- Nessus is the most famous cross-platform vulnerability scanner
- It has Graphical User Interface
- It is compatible with almost every operating system
- A limited freeware 'Nessus Home' version is available for home networks
### OpenVAS/GVM
- OpenVAS was renamed from Greenbone Vulnerability Management or GVM
- a fully featured vulnerability scanner but its also one component of the larger Greenbone Security Manager (GSM)
- It performs over 50k vulnerability tests that can run authenticated/ unauthenticated tests covering a wide range of protocols in addition to the ability to write custom tests
### SQLMap
- is an open source penetration tool
- it automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers
- powerful detection engine and many niche features
