# threat Modelling
Identifying what threats an organisation, a target network, or an in-scope app should be worried about it
- For Pen Testing:
    - modelling (mapping out)
    - the threats (things that can attack/harm)
    - To inform the types of activities conducted
    - and to inform the risk of the discovered vulnerabilities (how to present your findings about the vulnerabilities)
- After Pen Testing:
    - Applying countermeasures and mitigating controls to address the dangers
- Questions to ask when addressing a threat model:
    - Where am i most vulnerable
    - What are the most relevant threats
    - What do i need to safeguard against these threats
