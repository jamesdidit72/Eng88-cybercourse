# Introduction to Cyber Security

## Multiple definitions:
- NIST
  - The ability to protect or defend 
- CNSS
  - Prevention of damage
  - protection of and the restoration of computers, electronic communication systems etc
  - including information contained therein
  - to ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality and non-repudiation  

## The Cube (Cyber Security Cube (McCumber Cube))
### 1st Dimension - Desired goals
- Confidentiality
  - Unauthorised access is prevented (policies, ACLs)
  - able to read someones message (Alice, Bob and Trudy (ABT))  
- Integrity
  - Data should not be modified (by any unauthorised entity)
  - edit someones message (ABT)
- Availability
  - Access should not be unavailable
  - prevent someone getting the message (ABT)  

### 2nd Dimension - Data states
- Transmission
  - transferring data between information systems - also known as Data In Transit (DIT)
- Storage
  - Data At Rest (DAT) in an information system, such as that stored in memory or on a magnetic tape or disk
- Processing
  - performing operations on data in order to achieve a desired objective  
### 3rd Dimension - Safeguards
- Human Factors
  - also referred to as personal
- Policy and Practices
  - administrative controls, also referred to as operations
- Technology
  - software and hardware-based solutions  
## Essential Terms
- Asset
    - What you are trying to protect
- Vulnerability
    - A weakness or gap in our protection efforts
    - Mistakes in the development process (bug)
        - **Causes of Vulnerabilities:**
            - design & development errors
            - poor system config
            - human errors
            - connectivity
            - complexity
            - passwords
            - user input
            - management
            - lack of training
            - communication
- Exploit
    - The way hackers leverage vulnerabilities
- Threat
    - A threat is what we're trying to protect against
- Risk
    - The intersection of assets, threats and vulnerabilities

## Cyber Threats
- Malware
- Spyware
- Phishing
- DDoS
- Ransomware
- Zero-day exploits
- Advanced persistent threats

- Trojan
- Wiper attacks
- Intellectual property theft
- Theft of money
- Data manipulation
- Data destruction
- Man in the Middle attack
- Drive by downloads
- Malvertising

- Rogue Software
- Unpatched Software
- Natural disaster disrupting data centre
- Water holing
- Spearing
- Developing a botnet

#### Cyber Threat Surface
- All of the available endpoints that a threat actor may attempt to exploit in Internet-connected devices within the cyber threat environment
- the many processes that produce, deliver and rely on information systems connected to the internet are also potential threat vectors and targets
- Services, devices and data can all be targeted
- systems that connect physical entities with the internet
### Threat actors
- Nation-states: Motivation(M) = Geopolitical
- CyberCriminals: M = Profit
- Hacktivists: M = Ideological
- Terrorist Groups: M = Ideological violence
- Thrill seeker: M = Satisfaction
- insider threats: M = Discontent 

### Cyber Kill Chain
- Recon
- Weaponisation
- Delivery
- Exploitation
- Installation
- Command & Control (C2)
- Actions on Objectives
- Destroy
Installation: establishing a foothold on an asset

Types of attacks: targeted and untargeted

Integrity is a benefit of encrypting with a private key

Definition of a hash: Hashing is a one-way function where a unique message digest is generated from an input file or a string of text. No keys are used

**Non-repudiation** means a user cant deny signing something
