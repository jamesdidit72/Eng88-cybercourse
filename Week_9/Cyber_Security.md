# Introduction to Cyber Security

## Multiple definitions:
- NIST
  - The ability to protect or defend 
- CNSS
  - Prevention of damage
  - protection of and the restoration of computers, electronic communication systems etc
  - inlcuding information contained therein
  - to ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality and non-repudiation  

## The Cube (Cyber Security Cube (McCumber Cube))
### 1st Dimension - Desired goals
- Confidentiality
  - Unauthorised access is prevented (policies, ACLs)
  - able to read someones message (Alice, Bob and Trudy (ABT))  
- Integrity
  - Data should not be modified (by any unauthorised entity)
  - edit someones message (ABT)
- Availability
  - Access should not be unavailable
  - prevent someone getting the message (ABT)  

### 2nd Dimension - Data states
### 3rd Dimension - Safeguards

## Essential Terms
- Asset
    - What you are trying to protect
- Vulnerability
    - A weakness or gap in our protection efforts
    - Mistakes in the development process (bug)
        - **Causes of Vulnerabilities:**
            - design & development errors
            - poor system config
            - human errors
            - connectivity
            - complexity
            - passwords
            - user input
            - management
            - lack of training
            - communication
- Exploit
    - The way hackers leverage vulnerabilities
- Threat
    - A threat is what we're trying to protect against
- Risk
    - The intersection of assets, threats and vulnerabilities
